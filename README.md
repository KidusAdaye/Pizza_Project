# Pizza_Project
This data analytics project uses SQL and Tableau to analyze and model the sales data of a local pizza store. The data was transformed and queryed in SQL and visualizations were
created in tableau to analyze key trends and patterns. The results were presented in a tableau dashboard, allowing the owners to explore and make data-driven decision making for
the betterment of their store. 

Thanks to the creators of Maven Analytics for the dataset that is available to the public. It can be found here --
